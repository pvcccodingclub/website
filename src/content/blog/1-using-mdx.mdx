**Note to PVCC Coding Club members: This is an example blog post showing how to use MDX in Astro.**

## What is MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from "../../components/HeaderLink.astro";

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
    Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
